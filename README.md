Overview
========

This repository accompanies NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide 1800-34 - Validating the Integrity of Computing Devices. Visit the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) project website for more information and project status. 

NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guides (Special Publication 1800 series) target specific cybersecurity
challenges in the public and private sectors. They are practical, user-friendly guides that facilitate the
adoption of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. They show members of the information
security community how to implement example solutions that help them align with relevant standards
and best practices, and provide users with the materials lists, configuration files, and other information
they need to implement a similar approach.

This preliminary draft of Volume C describes the steps necessary to set up an environment that focuses
on laptop (sometimes referred to by industry as client) computing devices. It also provides guidance on
the operational usage of manufacturers’ tools that may be useful to your IT personnel who verify that
the computing device is acceptable to receive into the acquiring organization.

Participating Collaborators
